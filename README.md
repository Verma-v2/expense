This is Expenseeve Web App

I have created three Web Pages one is Home Page which shows Table of all Expenses and Two links to move to next to Pages. There is also a Add Expenses Button in this Page, after clicking Add Expenses it will show the Pie Chart, code is compiling but i don't know why it is not showing Pie Chart. All three Files for Web Page are inside Pages Folder.

Settings Page consist of Total Budget which takes input in form of number and a category through which you can select from available items. It is also showing list of all the items, by clicking on Delete Button you can delete the item but it is only temprarily deleted. I have created array of Items and after Clicking Delete Button rest of the items set new state of array of items.

The last Page is Profile Page which is used to login by taking credentials name, email id and mobile number.

I have not used Backend Technology as i don't have and i have to submit this assignment. So, the Pie Chart of percentage of expense is not created.
